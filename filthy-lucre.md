## Capitalism is Natural

- Political thought has converged; the left gave up on communism, the right gave up on libertarianism
- Intellectual appeal of libertarianism: based on a very small set of principles
- Darwinianism can lead to "bad" fitness, eg giant trees. if natural selection was optimizing, life on earth would be one smooth layer of bacteria. 
- Root cause: collective action problems. 
- In markets: agreeing to collectively follow the law. Promises/threats are not credible
- Enforcement agency of the state must be funded by taxes
- "Bare-bones" government doesn't work well either, eg bank runs before FDIC
- Bankruptcy protection and limited liability both forms of coercive social insurance

## Incentives Matter
